**The Struggle:** We're getting consistent website traffic but have made zero sales.

**What I've Tried:**

* **Ads:** Ran campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, and Google.
* **Influencers:** Collaborated with micro-influencers through Social Cat.
* **Result:** We've grown to about 55 followers organically, which is great, but it hasn't converted at all.

I'm trying to figure out if it's the messaging, the product photography, the pricing, or something else entirely.

Has anyone else in the jewelry niche experienced this painful gap between traffic and sales? I would be so grateful for any similar stories or advice on what finally worked for you.

I finally launched my jewelry brand, Mukti, in February. It's a dream project for me, but I'm hitting a wall I can't get past. The Struggle: We're getting consistent website traffic but have made zero sales. What I've Tried: Ads: Ran campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, and Google. Influencers: Collaborated with micro-influencers through Social Cat. * Result: We've grown to about 55 followers organically, which is great, but it hasn't converted at all. I'm trying to figure out if it's the messaging, the product photography, the pricing, or something else entirely. Has anyone else in the jewelry niche experienced this painful gap between traffic and sales? I would be so grateful for any similar stories or advice on what finally worked for you.
