You hit the root issues clearly: mansion MVP, empty-market illusion, and scaling costs before traction. Your “3 coders, 0 marketers” line is painfully accurate because that is where most health-tech apps quietly die.

But our first year was spent on talking to people, marketing and pitching to investors. Eventually, we secured preseed by EOY1. Our second year was the attempt to supercharge tech velocity via hiring contractors and going agro on marketing to ""pressure the tech team"" to build fast. So by EOY2, we had preseed investors, pitch award medals/certs local and intl, beta testers, active socmed, user contacts, marketing interns, hiring experience, an incubator, domain-specific mentors, etc. but no product...

Most ""failed"" projects don't fail because of bad code, they fail because they solved a problem people didn't care about. Validation doesn't have to be this huge, formal thing either.

Business model: Monthly subscriptions ($9-39/mo). Launched today, zero customers so far, figuring it out in public. Where I'm launching: You're looking at it - Reddit, LinkedIn, that's it.

Find subs where you can share your concert reviews (and photos, etc.) and that of your users. Find subs where you can engage with your target audience in a way that serves your product. A question like ""How do you make sure you don't forget your concert experiences?"" is something you could often ask. The goal of these interactions should be to leave a link to your app. 2- Ask your users and listen to the people you engage with (see previous step).

It was the uncomfortable conversations where someone told me the thing I built was not what they needed. What stood out in your post is how early the gut signals were there. The empty market, the lack of pull, the features drifting away from real demand. Those signals are easy to ignore when you have good tech and momentum.
